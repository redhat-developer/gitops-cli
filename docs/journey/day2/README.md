# Day 2 Operations

Day 2 Operations are actions that users take to change a GitOps system.

Currently, the following gitops commands are available to allow users to add new
Evnrionments and Applications/Services.

* [kam environment](../../commands/environment)
* [kam service](../../commands/service)
* [kam webhook](../../commands/webhook)

## Prerequisites

* A kam system that has been bootstrapped in [Day 1 Operations](../day1)
* A new Git repository to be used as the new Service's source repository.
* Download official [kam](https://github.com/redhat-developer/kam/releases/latest) binary

## Create a new Environment

To generate resources for a new Environment, you simiply run this command.

```shell
$ kam environment add \
  --env-name new-env \
  --pipelines-folder <path to GitOps folder>
```

It adds a new Environment `new-env` in the Pipelines Model.

```yaml
environments:
- name: new-env
  pipelines:
    integration:
      bindings:
      - github-push-binding
      template: app-ci-template
```

And, it generates the following yamls.  The new resources are namespace and role bindings.

* `environments/<env-name>/env/base/<env-name>-environment.yaml`

## Create an Application/Service in the new Environment

To generate resources for the new Service, run the foolowing command.

```shell
$ kam service add \
  --env-name new-env \
  --app-name app-bus \
  --service-name bus \
  --git-repo-url http://github.com/<your organization>/bus.git \
  --pipelines-folder <path to GitOps file>
```


The `service add` command adds a new Service and Application under `new-env` Environment in the Pipelines Model as below.

```yaml
environments:
- apps:
  - name: app-bus
    services:
    - name: bus
      source_url: http://github.com/<your organization>/bus.git
      webhook:
        secret:
          name: webhook-secret-new-env-bus
          namespace: cicd
  name: new-env
  pipelines:
    integration:
      bindings:
      - github-push-binding
      template: app-ci-template
```

In the Application's folder, a kustomization.yaml is generated to reference the new Service.

* `environments/new-env/apps/app-bus/services/bus/base/kustomization.yaml`

In the Service's base folder, an empty `config` folder is created.   (Please create `config` if it does not exist.)  This is the folder you will add `deployment yaml` files to specify how the Service should be deployed.

* `environments/new-env/apps/app-bus/services/bus/base/config`

Similar to the Day 1 example, we will just deploy a dummy nginxinc image.  The following files should be added to `config` folder.

* `100-deployment.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: bus
  namespace: new-env
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: bus
      app.kubernetes.io/part-of: app-bus
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: bus
        app.kubernetes.io/part-of: app-bus
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:latest
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: bus
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        resources: {}
      serviceAccountName: default
status: {}
```

* `200-service.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: bus
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: app-bus
  name: bus
  namespace: dev
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 8080
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: bus
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: app-bus
status:
  loadBalancer: {}
```

* `kustomization.yaml`

```yaml
resources:
- 100-deployment.yaml
- 200-service.yaml
```

The new Service/Application will be deployed by ArgoCD.   An ArgoCD application yaml is generated in the ArgoCD environment.

* `config/argocd/<env>-<app>-app.yaml`

In the CI/CD Environment, a couple of resources are added or modified.

Webhook secret resource is generated.

* `config/cicd/base/03-secrets/webhook-secret-<env>-<service>.yaml`

The Event Listener is modified as below to add a `trigger` for the new Service's source repository to trigger continous integration.

* `config/cicd/base/08-eventlisteners/cicd-event-listener.yaml`

```yaml
  - bindings:
    - name: github-push-binding
    interceptors:
    - github:
        secretRef:
          namespace: tst-cicd
          secretKey: webhook-secret-key
          secretName: webhook-secret-new-env-bus
    - cel:
        filter: (header.match('X-GitHub-Event', 'push') && body.repository.full_name
          == 'wtam2018/bus')
        overlays:
        - expression: split(body.ref,'/')[2]
          key: ref
    name: app-ci-build-from-push-bus
    template:
      name: app-ci-template
```
## Commit and Push configuration to GitOps repoository

Now, you can push changes to your gitops repository. 

```shell
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Add new service"
$ git push origin master
```
 ArgoCD will automatically applies changes to the cluster and deploys your new service.   Pretty neat!

## Create Webhook

Create a webhook for the new source repository.   This will allow webhook on the source repository to trigger CI Pipeline to run continuous integration on the new Service's source.

```shell
$ kam webhook create \
    --access-token <git host access token> \
    --env-name new-env \
    --service-name bus \
    --pipelines-folder <path to GitOps folder>
```

Make some modifications to the new application source reposiotry and raise a PR.

CD Pipeline is triggered and run successfully.
![cd-pipelines-success.png](img/pipeline-success.png)

New Application is deployed by ArgoCD successfully.
![argocd.png](img/argocd.png)

Make a change to your application source, the `bus` repo from the example, it
can be as simple as editing the `README.md` and propose a change as a
Pull Request.

This should trigger the PipelineRun:
